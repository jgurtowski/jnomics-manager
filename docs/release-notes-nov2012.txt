Variation Service

The main functionality of the variation service is to identify genome variations
in a genome resequening project. This includes support for ingesting large
quantities of sequencing reads into the HDFS, mapping those reads to a reference
genome (using Bowtie2 or BWA), scanning the alignments for variants (using
SAMTools), and then exporting the variants in VCF format. The backend of the
service is implemented on Hadoop for high scalability and parallelism.

In this release we have: the client API described in the thrift spec, the client
command line program, server daemons, backend sequence analysis code and
supporting utilities for manipulating data in the HDFS. The Makefile has
correctly working targets defined for make deploy and make test. The tutorial is
available in the docs directory. Executing the client requires a functioning
server daemon and hadoop cluster which is available at ORNL.

In the next release we intend to improve the batch processing capabilities,
enhance support for IRIS, the narrative interface, and the Shock uploading
system by providing program metadata. We will also include new sequence
analysis features for reporting sample quality, basic functional analysis 
of the identified variants, and begin work on the RNA-seq analysis pipelines.
