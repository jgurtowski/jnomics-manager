## Aligning reads to a reference genome
####

This tutorial will focus on paired-end illumina sequencing files. Single-end
experiments will work as well by substituting `se` for `pe` in the commands below. 
Ensure the `bin` directory in this package is in your path.

1. First, import the experiment reads into your home directory on the cluster. 
Paired-end reads should be kept together during alignment so there is a special
command for uploading paired-end reads. It is assumed that you have two files
with paired reads in fastq format, the files can be either plain text, gzip'd
or bzip2'd. If you do not have reads of your own you can download them from the 
cluster with the following command:

       $> jk_fs_get /share/example/yeast_sim.1.fq.gz
       $> jk_fs_get /share/example/yeast_sim.2.fq.gz

Now that we have some data, lets upload it to our home directory.

       $> jk_fs_put_pe yeast_sim.1.fq.gz yeast_sim.2.fq.gz yeast

This will pair the reads and upload them to the cluster. The last argument is the base
name of the file that will be found in your home directory on the cluster. Because
this is a paired-end experiment the extension `.pe` will be added automatically.
After the upload process is complete, a file named yeast.pe should be your home directory.

Standard filesystem commands begin with the previx jk_fs_*

        $> jk_fs_ls
        $> jk_fs_get yeast.pe
        $> jk_fs_mkdir my_dir


2. Align with Bowtie2:
   
   To align the reads to a reference genome simply call jkbase compute with the bowtie argument.
    
      $> jk_compute_bowtie -in=yeast.pe -org=yeast -out=yeast_bowtie_align
   
   The organism flag selects the reference used in alignment. The organism must be supported by
the kbase infrastructure as a part of the controlled genome vocabulary. To list the available
genomes/organisms use:

      $> jk_compute_list_genomes -a


3. Check status of running Job 

   When the alignment task it started, the command will immediately return with a job reference id.
This reference id can be used to poll the status of the job using the commandline client.
   
      $> jk_compute_job_status -job=<jobID>


#####
## Downstream analysis (Calling SNPs)
####

 1. Calling SNPs takes the output from the alignment steps above and calls SNPs using the selected reference.

       $> jk_compute_samtools_snp -in=yeast_bowtie_align -org=yeast -out=yeast_snps

       
 2. Because SNPs are called in parallel across the genome multiple files are created by the previous command.
    To join the SNPs into a single VCF file use jkbase's vcfmerge function

       $> jk_compute_vcf_merge -in=yeast_snps --alignments=yeast_bowtie_align -out=yeast.vcf


 3. Download the combined vcf file to the client machine for local viewing.

       $> jk_fs_get yeast.vcf

       
 A local file named reads.vcf will be created containing all of the SNPs called by the pipeline.
