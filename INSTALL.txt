Jnomics uses Ant and Ivy for compilation

http://ant.apache.org/ivy/

To build the jnomics jar type:

$> ant jar

Compile and runtime dependencies should be downloaded by ivy, except for thrift which you should download and install from source (configure --with-java=yes && make && make install)

Add $HOME/bin/jnomics/bin to your command path.
