Jnomics uses Gradle (http://www.gradle.org/) to manage its build. 

To install, unzip this zip file into your $HOME/bin directory and build the enclosed source code, issue the gradlew build command from this directory:

   ./gradlew build

Gradle should pull in all compile and runtime dependencies, including the Hadoop libraries. Once complete, there should be two jar files: jnomics-tools.jar and jnomics-examples.jar. 

Finally, add $HOME/bin/jnomics/bin to your command path.

For more detailed installation instructions, please see https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jnomics/index.php?title=Quickstart
