OVERVIEW - Variation Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main functionality of the variation service is to identify genome variations
in a genome resequening project. This includes support for ingesting large
quantities of sequencing reads into the HDFS, mapping those reads to a reference
genome (using Bowtie2 or BWA), scanning the alignments for variants (using
SAMTools), and then exporting the variants in VCF format. The backend of the
service is implemented on Hadoop for high scalability and parallelism.
