OVERVIEW - Variation Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main functionality of the variation service is to identify genome variations
in a genome resequening project. This includes support for ingesting large
quantities of sequencing reads into the HDFS, mapping those reads to a reference
genome (using Bowtie2 or BWA), scanning the alignments for variants (using
SAMTools), and then exporting the variants in VCF format. The backend of the
service is implemented on Hadoop for high scalability and parallelism.

VERSION 0.0.2 (Released May 31, 2013)
-------------------------------------

NEW FEATUES:

- Added jk_* script generator for IRIS compatibility

- User Account information retrieved from IRIS Environment, integration with GlobusOnline

- Improved commandline help, added longer descriptions that are useful

- Internal enhancements for batch processing and logging

RNASeq Service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RNASeq service is built on the variation service and extends capabilties to identify
new genes and perform comprehensive expression analysis of the RNASeq data. This service 
includes a splice junction mapper, Tophat to align the RNASeq reads to a reference genome 
and Cufflinks, a software package to assemble transcripts and identity differential expression
The service backend includes HDFS data store and grid engine for scheduling parallel jobs.

VERSION 0.4 (Released Nov 22, 2013)
-------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:

-Integrated Tophat and Cufflinks tools to the jnomics package
 
-Added functionality to schedule jobs on the grid engine

-Retrieve job status from grid engine and copying log files to hdfs

-Copy data between Shock and HDFS
