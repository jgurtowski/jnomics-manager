Jnomics - High Throughput Sequencing Analysis

The code found in this repository contains the 
client and server code for the jnomics-manager.
The code is dependent on the core jnomics package
which is held as a submodule in the 'jnomics'
subdirectory at the root of the package.

The jnomics-manager is responsible for handling
authenticaton and workflows. It is the interface
to the backend hadoop cluster.

Dependencies:
Thrift needs to be installed with at least the
java bindings

Building:
	To build the barebones package, run:
	$> ant
	A jar file dist/jnomics-manager-*.jar will
	be created
	 
Kbase Deployment:
      Kbase deployment makes use of the Makefile
      in the root of the package. The primary
      target is 'deploy'.

      	$> make deploy

      This should deploy all code to the 
      kbase deployment path.
